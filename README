Usage Instructions
==================

Server
------

To run the game server, execute the following command:

    ./server.sh server.xml

Or, alternatively:

    java -jar game.jar --server server.xml

Where `server.xml` is the name of the server configuration file (note a default
configuration file is provided). If no file is given, will assume `server.xml`.

A detailed event log will be produced in the `log.html` file.

Client
------

To run the game client, execute the following command:

    ./client.sh

Or, alternatively (for Windows, use "windows" instead of "linux"):

    java -Djava.library.path=lib/lwjgl/native/linux/ -jar game.jar

You can select the server's hostname/IP and port at the login screen.

Saving & Loading
================

The server will save the entire world state along with each player's last known
position, and inventory, and will restore it when the player rejoins the server
with the same name (players are identified by their login name) - no state will
be saved on the client side, so this is similar in design to how MMO's work.

(anything else we might want to put in here for the interview)
